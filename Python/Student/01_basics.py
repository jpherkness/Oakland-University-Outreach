# Basic Syntax
# ------------
# Syntax is similar to grammar for programmers.

# COMMENTS
# --------
# This is a comment.
# That means Python will let you write notes to yourself and to the other coders checking out your code
# And Python won't run this at all, or even notice it.
# The # symbol is what creates a comment.

# OUTPUT
# ------
# To output information, we can use the print function. We will learn more about
# what a function is later.
# Python will run commands from top to bottom, left to right

print("Hello World")  # This is how we print sentences
print(42) 			  # This is how we print numbers

# EXERCISE 1: Print your name
# ---------------------------

# EXERCISE 2: Print your age
