# INPUT
# -----
# In python we can use the input function to ask the user for some information.
# The string inside the parenthesis is called the prompt.

i = input("Enter something: ")


# EVALUATION
# ----------
# When we want to convert a string to a number we use the following function.

ten1 = eval("10")
ten2 = 10

# These two statements are the same
# This is very useful when you are trying to prompt the user for a number.

num = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
