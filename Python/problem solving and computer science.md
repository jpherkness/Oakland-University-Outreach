### What is *Computer Science*

---

### *Computer science* is the study of *problems*, *problem-solving*, and the *solutions* that come out of the problem-solving process.

---

### Given a *problem*, a computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an *algorithm*

---

### What is an *algorithm*?

---

### An *algorithm* is a step-by-step list of *instructions* for solving any instance of the problem that might arise

### *Baking a cake* (algorithm)

```
1. Preheat oven to 325 F
2. Gather ingredients
3. Mix ingredients in bowl
4. Pour mixture into baking pan
5. Bake in oven for 50 minutes
6. Wait 10 minutes, for cake to cool
7. Cut cake into 10ths
8. Eat cake ... which is not a lie
```
