# [fit] *Python*

---

### What is *python*?

---

### Python is a *high-level scripting language* used by companies like *youtube* & *dropbox.*

---

### *Creating* & *Executing* scripts

---

### To *Create* a python script, add the extention *```.py```* to any text file

---

### To *Execute* a python script, Navigate into the directory containing your script, then type the following into your command line <br> *```python3 script_name.py```*

---

### *Variables*

---
### A *variable* stores a piece of *data*, and gives it a specific *name*

```python

# Integers
x = 1

# Doubles
pi = 3.14

# Strings
school = 'Oakland University'

# Booleans
having_fun = True

```

---

### You can *change* the value of a variable by *reassigning* it

```python

my_int = 1
my_int = 3

my_double = 1.23
my_double = 4.56

my_string = 'Oakland'
my_string = 'Univeristy'

my_bool = True
my_bool = False

```

---

# now you *try it*!

```python
# Create a script called 'variables.py`
# Now assign the appropriate values to the variables below

age = 

name = 

coding = 

pi = 

```

---

### *Comments*

---

### *Comments* are used so that other programmers can *understand* what your code does

---

### *Arithmetic* Operators 

---

# *Arithmetic* Operators 
```python
addition = 42 + 5
subtraction = 34 - 13
multiplication = 3 * 4
division = 10 / 2
exponentiation = 2 ** 3
modulo = 3 % 2

# What would be the result of these operations?
```

---

# now you *try it*!

```python
# Create a script called 'math_is_fun.py`
# Using Arithmetic operators, produce the following values

addition = 12
subtraction = 52
multiplication = 40
division = 3
exponentiation = 16
modulo = 2


```

---

# *Tip* Calculator

```python

# Create a script called 'tip_calculator.py'
# Create variables for the following four values:
#	1. Meal (Some dollar amount)
#	2. Tax Percentage (0.0675)
#	3. Tip Percentage (0.15)
#	4. Total
# Calculate the total using these varables

```

---
# *Tip* Calculator *(solution)*

```python
meal = 44.50
tax = 0.0675
tip = 0.15

# Notice that we apply the tax first
meal = meal + meal * tax

# Then we add the tip
total = meal + meal * tip

print("%.2f" % total)
```
