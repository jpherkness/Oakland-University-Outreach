# NOTES: DECISIONS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Decision statements determine whether or not a block of code should be
# executed based on a boolean condition.

# IF STATEMENT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if 10 > 5:  # (10 > 5) is referred to as the condition
	print("10 is greater than 5")  # This statement will execute
# Note: notice the colon and indentations

# IF-ELSE STATEMENT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if 10 < 1:
	print("10 is less than 1")
else:
	print("10 is greater than 1")  # This statement will exicute

# NESTED IF STATEMENT (IF-ELSEIF-ELSE STATEMENT)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if 10 < 10:
	print("10 is less than 10")
elif 10 == 10:
	print("10 is equal to 10")  # This statement will execute
else:
	print("10 is greater that 10")

# EXERCISE 1: Write a program that prompts the user for their password. If
# their password matches the stored password then print 'Correct!'.
# However, if their password does not match the stored password
# print 'Incorrect!'
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	print("Correct!")
else:
	print("Incorrect!")

# EXERCISE 2: Write a program that asks the user whether they want to solve for
# velocity, time, or distance. Based on their answer, prompt them for the
# appropriate inputs, and solve for that answer. When you're finished, display
# the answer to the user.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
