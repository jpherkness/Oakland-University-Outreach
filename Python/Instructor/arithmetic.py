# NOTES: ARITHMETIC

# Arithmetic is just a fancy way of saying math.
# Computer Scientists use math all the time.
# Arithmetic operators let us combine, change, or modify numbers.

# QUESTION: What are some arithmetic operations?

# Arithmatic Operators
addition = 3 + 5              # 8
subtraction = 4 - 3           # 1
multiplication = 3 * 7        # 21
division = 1 / 3              # 0.33333333
modulus = 27 % 10             # 7
integer_division = 27 // 10   # 2
exponentiation = 2 ** 3       # 8

# EXERCISE 1: Come up with your own operations using each operator.
